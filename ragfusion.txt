    "response": "Here is a summary of Apple's recent performance in China, based on the latest available disclosures and news:\n\nSEC Filings & Earnings Call Insights:\n- In Apple's most recent earnings call (Q3 2024), management reported that revenue in Greater China was down 11% year-over-year for the quarter. Over half of this decline was attributed to changes in channel inventory, and currency effects accounted for more than 50% of the year-over-year decline. On a constant currency basis, the decline was less than 3%.\n- Despite the revenue drop, Apple noted positive signals: the installed base of iPhones in Greater China reached a record high, and the company set a June quarter record for upgraders in Mainland China. The iPad also returned to growth in the region.\n- Management emphasized that China remains the most competitive market globally, but they remain confident in the long-term opportunity there. (Source: Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript)\n\nNews Articles:\n- According to CNBC (May-June 2024), Apple continues to face headwinds in China due to escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and new tariffs imposed by the U.S. administration. These tariffs are expected to increase production costs for Apple, potentially leading to higher consumer prices and reduced demand.\n- Apple is actively working to diversify its supply chain away from China, aiming to shift up to 25% of iPhone assembly to India. However, progress has been slow due to infrastructure and regulatory challenges. Despite these efforts, China still accounts for about 40% of Apple’s manufacturing capacity.\n- The news also highlights that Apple’s suppliers in Asia have experienced significant stock declines in response to the new tariffs, reflecting broader risks to the electronics sector. (Source: CNBC, Reuters)\n\nSummary:\n- Apple's recent performance in China has been mixed: revenue has declined, but the installed base and customer engagement remain strong. The company is navigating significant geopolitical and supply chain challenges, with ongoing efforts to reduce its dependence on China, though this transition is progressing slowly.\n\nIf you need more detailed financial figures or further breakdowns by product line, please let me know."
