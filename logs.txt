CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday opined on why it's currently hard to hold on to two of his favorite stocks, Nvidia and Apple. He primarily cited the Trump administration's harsh commerce policies with and attitude towards China.

<p>Shares of major Asian suppliers to Apple and NVIDIA experienced significant losses on Monday, as investors grappled with the fallout from President Trump&rsquo;s sweeping new tariffs on electronics and technology imports.</p>
<h2>Key Developments</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>South Korean Giants Hit Hard:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Samsung Electronics (KS:005930)</strong> fell 5%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SK Hynix (KS:000660)</strong> dropped by 8.1% as of 05:54 GMT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>U.S.-Listed TSMC:</strong><br />Shares of <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW:2330)</strong>, the world&rsquo;s largest contract chipmaker and a key foundry for both Apple and NVIDIA, closed 7% lower on Friday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hong Kong and Japan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>China&rsquo;s SMIC (HK:0981)</strong> plunged nearly 14%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Japan&rsquo;s Advantest Corp. (TYO:6857)</strong>, which supplies chip testing equipment to NVIDIA, declined over 9%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tariff Measures and Market Impact</h2>
<p>On April 2, President Trump announced a baseline tariff of 10% on all imports, with targeted higher rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>34% on Chinese goods</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>24% on Japanese products</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>25% on South Korean imports</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>32% on Taiwanese goods</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These aggressive tariffs aim to rebalance trade deficits but are expected to significantly raise production costs for companies like Apple and NVIDIA. Analysts warn that these cost pressures could ultimately lead to higher consumer prices and reduced demand for electronics. Meanwhile, suppliers face considerable headwinds, including potential shifts in manufacturing locations and supply chain disruptions.</p>
<h2>Technical Perspective</h2>
<p>From a technical analysis standpoint, momentum indicators signal that these stocks are in oversold territory. Investors can gain additional insights into this trend by monitoring the <strong>Williams %R</strong> indicator, which measures overbought and oversold conditions. For real-time technical data, check out the <a href="https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#technical-intraday-williams">Technical (Williams %R)</a> 
endpoint.</p>
<hr />
<p>As global trade tensions continue to reshape the technology supply chain, the significant declines in shares of key Asian suppliers underscore the broader risks faced by the electronics sector. The ripple effects of these tariffs could ultimately impact global technology giants and consumer prices, further intensifying market volatility in the coming months.</p>

<p>UBS reiterated its Neutral rating and $236 price target on <a href='https://financialmodelingprep.com/financial-summary/AAPL'>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)</a>, noting that iPhone sell-through trends turned negative year-over-year in February, particularly in China and Europe, where the company continues to lose market share.</p>
<p>According to UBS’ review of Counterpoint data, global iPhone sell-through dropped by 1% YoY, even as the broader smartphone market remained relatively flat. The declines were most pronounced in China (down 17%) and Europe (down 12%), signaling increasing competitive pressure in those regions.</p>
<p>While Apple did gain roughly 215 basis points of share in the U.S., overall iPhone sales in the region were still down 1%, reflecting a 5% contraction in the U.S. smartphone market during February amid muted promotional activity.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, Apple saw sell-through gains of about 20% in India and other emerging markets, though these increases came against easier comparisons from last year.</p>
<p>Initial demand for Apple’s latest SE model also underwhelmed, with only 300,000 units sold in its first month, far below the 700,000 units sold 
during the SE 2022 debut and a fraction of the 2.4 million units sold in the first month of the 2020 version.</p>
<p>UBS maintains a cautious stance, seeing limited upside in the near term as Apple navigates softening demand in core regions and lukewarm reception to its latest budget offering.</p>

- Recent news highlights that iPhone sell-through in China dropped by 17% year-over-year in February, according to UBS and Counterpoint data. This 
decline is more severe than the global iPhone sell-through drop of 1% and reflects increasing competitive pressure in China. While Apple gained market share in the U.S. and saw growth in India, the Chinese market remains a significant challenge (UBS via Financial Modeling Prep, April 2025).   

- Geopolitical tensions and new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports are adding further pressure, potentially increasing Apple's production costs and impacting demand. Apple is working to diversify its supply chain away from China, but progress has been slow due to infrastructure and regulatory hurdles in alternative markets like India (Recent news analysis, April 2025).

In summary, Apple is experiencing a decline in sales in China, driven by both competitive and macroeconomic factors, but continues to maintain a strong brand presence and is investing for long-term growth in the region. For more details, see the latest Apple earnings call and recent news reports.
